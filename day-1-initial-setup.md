# Day 1: Kicking Off with Toolbox and a Fresh Dev Mindset

## Why I’m Doing This

I'm restarting my development journey with intention — building real applications over the next 60–90 days and treating it like a job. My goal is to develop consistency, sharpen my tooling, and improve my ability to structure, document, and complete real-world projects.

## Getting Back into the Flow

Fedora Silverblue has been my OS for a while now, but I hadn’t fully leveraged its development workflow until now. Today I officially activated **Toolbox** to create a clean, containerized environment where I can write code, install languages, and keep my host system pristine.

### What I Did

- Activated and entered my first Toolbox environment
- Installed CLI tools like Git and GitHub CLI (`gh`) inside the container
- Reconnected my GitHub account via CLI for automation
- Sketched out the idea of a custom script to streamline future project setup
- Set up folders to separate project work from general files

### Reflections

Toolbox instantly clicked for me — having an isolated, host-independent development shell that shares my home directory feels like the best of both worlds. This environment gives me the confidence to experiment without worrying about messing up my base system.

I also began thinking critically about process: what’s reusable, what’s manual, what can be automated? That mindset is going to shape this whole journey.

## Next Steps

- Connect VS Code to my Toolbox environment
- Write and test my custom `newproject` script
- Start journaling daily to track progress, tools, and lessons
