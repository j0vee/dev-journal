# Day 4: Notion is Live

## Goals
- Set up Notion as a central hub for my dev journey
- Add objectives for the current week
- Begin prepping objectives for next week

## What I Did
- Created my **Dev Journey Hub** in Notion  
- Set up 4 main sections:
  - Weekly Planner  
  - Project Board for FreelanceFlow  
  - Study Tracker  
  - Resume + Job Application Center

## Challenges Encountered
- Spent the first hour overwhelmed — Notion felt like a blank canvas with endless possibilities, which was intimidating  
- I'm used to a structured path, so figuring out how to begin took time

## Solutions & Breakthroughs
- As I started building sections, the value became clearer — having everything in one place is going to be powerful  
- I’ll keep adjusting it over time, but for now it looks great and is fully usable

## Next Steps
- Return to FreelanceFlow and begin following the structured learning plan I created in Notion

## Self-Reflection / Notes
I’m feeling optimistic. I heard someone say, “If you feel like you don’t know what you’re doing, but you show up anyway, then you’re doing something right.” That really resonates — and honestly, that’s my life right now.
