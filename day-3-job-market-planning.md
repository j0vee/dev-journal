## Self-Reflection / Notes
A while back, I completed a full-stack bootcamp. I had momentum, but the rejections hit hard. In hindsight, I see now that I wasn’t quite ready — there was still so much to learn. That doesn’t diminish the experience though; it was valuable and sparked a true love for development.

Now I’m back, more grounded, and ready to grow. This time, I’m documenting everything — every win, every struggle, every lesson. Wish me luck — I’m in this for real now.
