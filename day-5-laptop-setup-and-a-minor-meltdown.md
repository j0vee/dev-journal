# Day 5: Laptop Setup and a Minor Meltdown

## Goals
- Set up laptop to mirror desktop environment  
- Update Notion to reflect new timeline

## What I Did
- Set up my Toolbox environment on the laptop so I can develop when away from my desktop  
- Cloned both `dev-journal` and `FreelanceFlow` repos to keep my projects accessible  
- Updated Notion to reflect the shift in progress and priorities

## Challenges Encountered
My desktop isn't displaying anything on the monitor, and I honestly don’t even know where to start troubleshooting it. I know myself — I’ll go down a rabbit hole eventually to fix it, but first I needed to get my laptop ready so I could continue working on my goals.

I guess in a way this will help me level up some IT skills too. Normally, I'd vent to my husband and let him handle the hardware issues, but this time I want to embrace the whole journey. I’ll admit — I was really thrown off. I had a mini panic attack when it wouldn’t boot. I was discouraged because I wanted to stick to my timeline… but let’s be real: it wouldn’t be a dev journey without blockers.

## Solutions & Breakthroughs
- Successfully cloned both `dev-journal` and `FreelanceFlow` repos to the laptop  
- Updated Notion and rescheduled my due dates to accommodate the unexpected hiccup  

## Next Steps
- Keep moving forward and stay on track  
- Prep for an upcoming virtual interview — not for a job (yet), but for networking purposes. I’ll journal about that on Friday!

## Self-Reflection / Notes
Despite the hiccup, I still feel good about everything. Every issue I face is just another challenge keeping me sharp. And honestly, documenting all of this feels right. When I look back, I know I’ll be proud of how far I’ve come — even through the messy days.
